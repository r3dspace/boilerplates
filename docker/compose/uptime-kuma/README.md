# 📄 Uptime-Kuma

Uptime Kuma is an easy-to-use self-hosted monitoring tool.


## 🛠️ Setup by docker compose example

> [!Note]
> This example uses a reverse proxy such as [Caddy](../caddy/). However, it can also be run without one. In this case, the `ports:` option will need to be set and the `networks:` objects disabled or removed in the Docker Compose file.
